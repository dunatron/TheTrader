## Tech

- React => For building the interface along with:
  - `Next.js` for server side rendering, routing and tooling
  - `StyledComponents` for styling
  - `React-Apollo` for interfacing with Apollo Client
  - `Material-UI` for theming and styling _(works well with styled components)_
- Apollo Client => For data management:
  - Perform GraphQL `Mutations`
  - Fetching GraphQL `Queries`
  - `Caching` GraphQL data
  - Managing `Local State`
  - `Error` and `Loading` UI states
  - _Note: Apollo client replaces the need for redux + data fetching/caching libraries_
- GraphQL Yoga => An express GraphQL Server for:
  - Implementing `Query` and `Mutation Resolvers`
  - Custom `Server Side Logic`
  - `Charging` credit cards
  - `Sending Email`
  - Performing `JWT Authentication`
  - Checking `Permissions`
- Prisma => A GraphQL database interface:
  - Provides a set of GraphQL `CRUD APIs` for MySQL or Postgres database
  - `Schema` Definition
  - Data `Relationships`
  - `Queried` directly from our Yoga server
  - `Self-hosted` or `as-a-service`
